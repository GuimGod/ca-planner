/**
 * The special attacks that lowered one monster's Defence (and Magic), and the levels it is left with.
 *
 * <p>Each special attack is taken off the levels the one before left, in the order they landed: the game lowers the
 * level the monster has at the time (OSRS Wiki, Dragon warhammer and Elder maul: "each reduction is calculated from the
 * current temporary level"; Bandos godsword: "drains the opponent's combat levels equal to the damage dealt"). Each one
 * is worked out as the OSRS Wiki DPS calculator works it out ({@code applyDefenceReductions}: each fraction rounded
 * down, no Defence below the monster's floor, a Bandos godsword's damage beyond the Defence left going on to Strength,
 * Attack, Magic and Ranged); the calculator only has counts and applies them in one order of its own (Accursed sceptre,
 * Elder maul, Dragon warhammer, Arclight, Emberlight, Tonalztics of Ralos, Seercull, Bandos godsword, Eye of Ayak), which
 * is the order they landed in when they landed so.
 *
 * <p>Rules the calculator does not have come from the game (OSRS Wiki): an Elder maul or Dragon warhammer that fails to
 * hit Tekton still takes 5% of his Defence, and a Bandos godsword that fails to hit him takes 10 levels; the Accursed
 * sceptre takes a level already lowered no further than 15% below the full one, and the Seercull lowers Magic only while
 * it is full; the bone dagger and the Dorgeshuun crossbow lower Defence by their damage only while it is full, and the
 * Barrelchest anchor lowers one level by a tenth of its damage. The Vulnerability spell, which the calculator also has,
 * is not a special attack: nothing reports it.
